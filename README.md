Hello! This is an Instagram clone built using Flask for the server-side and React for the client-side. The backend, powered by Flask, handles user authentication, API requests, and database management using SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. On the client-side, React provides a dynamic and responsive user interface, allowing for smooth interactions and real-time updates.

Core features include user authentication, the ability to post photos, like and comment on posts, and an infinite scrolling feed. RESTful APIs connect the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless communication and a smooth user experience. This project showcases the integration of modern web technologies to create a fully functional social media platform.
